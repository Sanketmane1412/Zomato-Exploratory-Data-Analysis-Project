# Zomato-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato restaurant dataset to understand patterns and trends in the food delivery and restaurant industry. The main goal of this project was to analyze real-world data and derive meaningful insights that can help in decision-making.

In this project, I started by understanding the dataset structure and identifying missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent data. I applied data cleaning techniques using Pandas to handle null values and improve data quality. After preprocessing, I performed detailed exploratory analysis to study restaurant ratings, cuisine types, country-wise and city-wise distribution, and customer preferences.

I used Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization to represent insights in a clear and understandable manner. Through visual analysis, I was able to identify popular cuisines, rating distributions, and how restaurant availability varies across different locations. This helped me understand how data visualization plays an important role in storytelling and insight generation.

Through this project, I learned how to work with real datasets, apply EDA techniques, and interpret data insights effectively. The skills and concepts learned here can be applied in future data analytics and data science projects for business analysis and decision support.
